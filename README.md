# Planner App

## Plan your time


**Project Proposal:**

The application I am designing is a planner app. This app will help keep track of events and todo lists while also
boosting one's productivity. The monthly view will provide an overview of events or deadlines coming up. The weekly 
view will provide a break-down of the week ahead and of the smaller tasks that need to get done. Using the ideas of 
time-blocking, this app will allow one to schedule not only the nature of the task, but also the time when one will 
work on it. Additionally, a habit tracker will be built into the app. This will allow users to add habits that they 
want to work on and check them off daily, weekly or monthly depending on their choice. 
This application helps one get their professional life in order through scheduling while also motivating
 them to continue working on their personal goals by tracking their habits. 
 
 Some Features:
 - monthly view: shows events and deadlines in the month ahead
 - weekly view: shows schedule of the week ahead along with todo list items
 - habit tracker: helps track daily, weekly or monthly habits of one's choice
 
 
 This app can be used by anyone who wants to organize their time. It may be especially useful for students in helping 
 them keep track of assignments and schedule their study time. This project interests me because I have seen the 
 benefits of using a planner and scheduling time in my own life. Scheduling time has always been important in boosting 
 productivity; however, with the current pandemic and the shift towards online classes it's usefulness has only 
 increased. Clearly dividing one's work time and down time can be extremely useful in managing stress and one's overall 
 mental health. The idea of planning one's time is simple, but it's impact is profound. Therefore, I am looking forward to 
 creating this app!
